# DocShadrach's Reaper Scripts

You need to edit some scripts before importing them into Reaper. The scripts you need to edit are the ones that start with the filename [toEDIT] and what you need to edit inside is what appears in capital letters in the filename (for example: TRACKNAME, RANGE, etc). To edit them simply use any text editor. Then rename the file keeping the .lua extension at the end of the file name. To load them into Reaper you need to open the action list and from there click on "New action" - "Load ReaScript" and find the edited file you created.
